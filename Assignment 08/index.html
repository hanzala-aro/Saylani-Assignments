        <h2>Aurat March Islamabad strongly condemns ‘harassment’ faced by woman MPA by PTI lawmakers</h2>
        <p>US Secretary of State Antony Blinken called President Joe Biden’s decision to rescind the designation “a
          recognition of
          the dire humanitarian situation in Yemen”. He said the new US administration listened to warnings from the
          United
          Nations, humanitarian groups, bipartisan members of Congress and others “that the designations could have a
          devastating
          impact on Yemenis’ access to basic commodities like food and fuel”.</p>
        <p>Yemen imports 90 per cent of its food, nearly all purchased through commercial channels, and UN humanitarian
          chief Mark
          Lowcock warned last month that the US designation of the Houthis already had companies pulling back from
          dealing with
          the Yemenis and would likely lead to “a large-scale famine on a scale that we have not seen for nearly 40
          years”.
        </p>
        <p>Blinken’s announcement followed a phone conversation on Thursday with UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres,
          where Yemen
          was one of the issues they discussed. UN spokesman Stephane Dujarric on Friday called the US action “extremely
          positive”. “We hope that helps build momentum for a political solution to the conflict in Yemen,” Dujarric
          said. “I
          think the reversal of the designation, the naming of the [US] special envoy [for Yemen], and the clear, clear
          language
          from the top of the administration, from president Biden himself, expressing his strong support for the UN-led
          mediation
          process [...] are very, very welcome indeed.”
        </p>
        <p>In 2014, the rebel Houthis overran the capital, Sanaa, and much of Yemen’s north, driving the government into
          exile. A
          US-backed, Saudi-led coalition intervened the following year to try and restore the internationally recognised
          government, but years of UN efforts to get both sides to agree to a ceasefire and start peace negotiations
          have not
          succeeded. The conflict has been disastrous for Yemen, the Arab world’s poorest country, killing more than
          112,000
          people, creating a humanitarian disaster, and wrecking infrastructure from roads and hospitals to water and
          electricity
          networks.
        </p>
        <p>The State Department confirmed last week that Biden was moving to revoke the designation, a day after the
          president
          announced an end to offensive support to Saudi Arabia’s campaign against the Houthis.
